# Portfolio Instruments

Portfolio Instruments is a full-stack website built with all the tools needed to manage your passive investment portfolio.

Portfolio Instruments is useful for both beginner and advanced investors. Portfolio Instruments will take snapshots of your portfolio at various points in time and provide rebalance guidelines based on user-defined criteria.

Portfolio Instruments provides strong benchmark portfolios from which to reference so that users of all backgrounds have an easy way to manage their money. Portfolio Instruments provides an intuitive dashboard display that shows all the information that one might require as a passive investor.

## Motivation

For a large part of my early adult life, I spent a great deal of time reading about effective passive investing strategies. I have been an avid investor since I first began working, and I continue to believe that a solid passive investing strategy can greatly reduce the financial stress in ones life by providing greater stability.

Throughout my adult life, I have found myself repeating certain investing rebalance calculations which have become very tedious. This website was built to automate and intuitively display much of this information required to analyze your passive portfolio.

Many newcomers are usually unaware of how to begin investing. This website also aims to reduce the stress of passive investing for the new investor by breaking down strong benchmark portfolios that have been pre-chosen based on stability and popularity.
